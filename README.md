            <b>COVID19Forecaster – Python</b>
            <p></p>
            <p>A Python script that imports current and historical COVID-19 data from OurWorldInData.org and predicts the number of future cases numerically and graphically. It employs an LSTM neural network through Keras that uses the data to predict the number of cases tomorrow. It also implements the Gauss-Newton algorithm in fitting the historical data to multiple polynomial curves. Python libraries used: Keras (TensorFlow), Matplotlib, NumPy, Pandas, and Scikit-learn.</p>

            <b>HospitalSystem (Java)</b>
            <p></p>
            <p>An electronic communication and record-keeping system written in Java that can support an entire hospital. It has a graphical user interface built using JavaFX and CSS that provides a login screen and separate portals for patients, doctors, and nurses. Doctors and nurses can view patient info and provide treatment notes that the patient can see. The program utilizes locks and conditions around file I/O as well as CBC-mode AES encryption to protect confidential patient data in files.</p>

            <b>InfList (C++)</b>
            <p></p>
            <p>This library allows you to work with infinite lists in C++. The lists are rendered using lazy evaluation: only the functional components of the infinite list are stored, and list values are only evaluated when they are needed. InfLists support complex operations with both built-in operators and user-defined functions.</p>

            <b>NameThatSound – HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (plus jQuery)</b>
            <p></p>
            <p>An interactive web app game designed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery. It helps linguists distinguish between unfamiliar sounds that are not present in General American English. It provides concentrated practice in the form of a game, where users hear a sound and choose which sound was played out of a list of similar sounds. The program uses responsive web design concepts to optimize the appearance of the game across different screen and viewport sizes. It tracks user progress using cookies and adjusts the game according to the user’s ability.</p>
